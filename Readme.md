1. Include the library as local library project.

    ``` compile 'com.yalantis:eqwaves:1.0.1' ```

2. Initialize Horizon object with params regarding to your sound

    ````java
    mHorizon = new Horizon(glSurfaceView, getResources().getColor(R.color.background),
                    RECORDER_SAMPLE_RATE, RECORDER_CHANNELS, RECORDER_ENCODING_BIT);
    ```

3. To update Horizon call updateView method with chunk of sound data to proceed
